# The-Nearsighted-Traveler

This is a game where you are in a maze but can only see the part of the maze that is right around where you are in the maze. 
Use wasd or arrow keys to move around.
This needs a lot of work and needs a few more elements to the game to really make it interesting, 
but as a basic proof of concept it works!

I would love feedback on it! How the ui could be better, 
how to better use a gui framework(stuff that applies to javafx and gui stuff as a whole),
any better ways to generate and display the maze on screen, 
and anything else.

**Thanks!**

Also *White Blood Cells* I was using it for testing just to change it up, 
and just thought i'd keep it around for now.
